Data X - Analysing a Matter of Fact

This is an application to build knowledge graph from a given document to display the relations between entities. 

Knowledge graph is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model to integrate data. These are used to store interlinked descriptions of entities. 

Steps involved:
1. Sentence segmentation - Spliting the text document into sentences. 
2. Entity extraction - Identifying and classiying key elements from text into pre defined category.
3. Relation extraction - Extracting semantic relationships from text. 
4. Building knowledge graph - Creating knowledge graph from extracted entities and predicates.
